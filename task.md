## Iteration 1 - Basic password validation


### Goal

Design and implement some code that validates a password.

The password will be provided by the user (as an argument of the method) and should return if the password is valid or not.

A valid password should meet the following criteria:

- Have more than 8 charactersa
- Contains a capital letter
- Contains a lowercase
- Contains a number
- Contains an underscore


### Technical requirements:

- We want a method that answers if the password is valid or not.
- We do not need to know the reason that the password is invalid
